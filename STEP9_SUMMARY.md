# Step 9: Dynamic Player Management - Implementation Summary

## What We Built

### 1. SpawnManager Class (`spawn_manager.gd`)
- **Spawn Points System**: 8 default spawn points around the level
- **Spawn Assignment**: Automatic assignment of available spawn points to players
- **Collision Avoidance**: Prevents spawning players on top of each other
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup when players leave

### 2. Enhanced PlayerManager
- **`spawn_player()`**: Create new players at runtime
- **`remove_player()`**: Remove players with full cleanup
- **Spawn Integration**: Uses SpawnManager for positioning
- **Resource Cleanup**: Proper cleanup of UI states and references

### 3. Enhanced GameManager  
- **`add_player_to_game()`**: Add players to game state
- **`remove_player_from_game()`**: Remove players from game state
- **`handle_mid_game_join()`**: Handle players joining ongoing games
- **Signal Management**: Connect/disconnect player signals dynamically

### 4. Enhanced PlatformManager
- **`remove_player_from_platforms()`**: Clean player from affected lists
- **`cleanup_player_platform_data()`**: Full platform cleanup for removed players
- **Dynamic Lists**: Platform affected_players automatically updated

### 5. Main Scene Integration
- **`spawn_new_player()`**: Complete player spawning workflow
- **`remove_existing_player()`**: Complete player removal workflow
- **Testing Methods**: Built-in test functions for validation

## Testing the System

### Test Controls:
- **F3**: Spawn a second player
- **F4**: Remove the second player  
- **F5**: Spawn multiple players (3, 4, 5)

### What to Expect:
```
=== Testing: Spawning second player ===
Spawn point added at: (0, 2, 15)
Player 2 assigned spawn point at: (-3, 2, 15)
Player 2 spawned at position: (-3, 2, 15)
Player 2 added to game with state: PLAYING
SUCCESS: Second player spawned at position: (-3, 2, 15)
```
